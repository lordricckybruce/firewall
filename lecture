firewalls and ids are related but not the same 
while fire walls are for packet filterng,tracking of site of active connections and make 
decision on the conetxt of traffic <stateful firewalls>
for proxy firewalls to intercept request

#IDS ---- 
IDS monitor networks and alerting



firewalls actively blocks or allows trffic 
ids passively monitiors and generate alerts

No, IDS are not firewalls. While firewalls block and control traffic, IDS systems only detect and alert on potential threats. Combining both provides better protection for your network and systems.



#Firewall with python
Yes, **Rust** can absolutely be used to build a firewall, though it's less common than using languages like Python or C due to its focus on safety and performance. Rust's memory safety features, along with its speed, make it a great choice for building a fast, secure, and efficient firewall system.

However, for most firewall implementations, languages like **Python** are preferred for ease of development, rapid prototyping, and large library support, while **Rust** might be chosen for situations requiring high performance and low-level control over network traffic, or if you want to leverage Rust's performance benefits for high-traffic systems.

### Here's a comparison:

- Python: You'd typically use existing libraries like `iptables` (via system calls), `scapy`, or `socket` to handle packet filtering, since Python offers more abstraction.
  
- Rust: You’d need to either directly work with system-level APIs like `libpcap` (which C libraries use) or implement low-level packet inspection using `pnet` or similar crates. This can provide better performance and memory safety guarantees but requires more effort in terms of setup and lower-level management.

### **Which one would you prefer?**
- Firewall in Python: Easier to get started, especially for learning purposes.
- Firewall in Rust: Higher performance and safety, but it might be more complex to set up initially.
